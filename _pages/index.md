The name of my website has two interpretations: Haley Smiles and Haley's Miles. I have collected many "hats" over the years and this website is intended to give a glimpse into each. In laymans terms, I am a UC Davis graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science. I moved to Tahoe during the summer of 2021 to start full time work as a Product Engineer at [Ridgeline](https://www.ridgelineapps.com).

During college, I worked as a research assistant in the [Cognition in Context Lab](https://cognitionincontext.ucdavis.edu) at the Center for Mind and Brain during my junior year. My main topics of interest included the development of creative problem solving, resilience, and delayed gratification during childhood. Additionally, I was also a Co-Curator for [TEDxUCDavis](http://www.tedxucdavis.org) 2021. We held a virtual event with 2000+ attendees. Lastly, I coached Cross Country and Track at Harper Middle school in Davis for 6 seasons. During the pandemic, I coached virtually and was forced to get creative to keep the season engaging, check out how I did so [here](https://www.davisenterprise.com/sports/harper-harriers-map-out-a-unique-thank-you-to-workers/). 

Outside of running, I love all things outdoors - my two newest endeavors include rock climbing and mountain biking. When I need a break from using my left brain, I enjoy writing, practicing my French, or re-reading my favorite books, *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves* and *Steppenwolf*. Feel free to take a look around my site. It's an ongoing project but you can find articles about various adventures under Blog and passion projects under Portfolio. More information on my past work experiences can be found under Resume or on LinkedIn.
