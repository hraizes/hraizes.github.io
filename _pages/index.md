The name of my website has two interpretations: Haley Smiles and Haley's Miles. I have collected many "hats" over the years and this website is intended to give a glimpse into each. In laymans terms, I am a fourth year undergraduate pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis.

I worked as a research assistant in the [Cognition in Context Lab](https://cognitionincontext.ucdavis.edu) at the Center for Mind and Brain during my junior year. My main topics of interest include the development of creative problem solving, resilience, and delayed gratification during childhood.

When I am not at the library, you can find me running around the city of Davis, preparing for my second marathon. For the past three years, I have coached Cross Country and Track at Harper Middle school in Davis. Outside of running, I love the outdoors - my two newest endeavors include rock climbing and mountain biking.

When I need a break from using my left brain, I enjoy writing, practicing my French, or re-reading my favorite books, *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves* and *Steppenwolf*. I am also a Co-Curator for TEDxUCDavis 2021. We are holding an online conference in the Spring of 2021. Check out our [website](http://www.tedxucdavis.org) for more information. Applications to apply as a speaker will be released in Fall 2020.

If I haven't bored you yet, feel free to take a look around my site. It's an ongoing project but you can find articles about various adventures and life lessons under Blog and passion projects under Portfolio. More information on my past work experiences can be found under Resume or on LinkedIn.
