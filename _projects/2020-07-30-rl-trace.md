RL Trace is a contact tracing application designed to notify users of potential exposures to coronavirus. The website allows a user to sign up, log in, submit a new event form each time they go out, and submit a report if they test postive for coronavirus. The application then notifys all users of potential exposures which overlap with an infected user from the time they started feeling sick through their diagnosed date.
